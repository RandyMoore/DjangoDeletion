# Dockerized Jupyter Environment on Django to Explore Relationship Cardinalities and Deletion Behaviors

To run install

* docker
* docker-compose

In the root of the project run
`docker-compose up`

A Jupyter server will launch and provide links, click the link containing `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=` to get the Jupyter environment in your browser.  Sample notebooks (`.pynb` files) will be in the root directory.  

The Django models are declared at `delete_example/models.py`. If you want to change the models you can run `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up --build` in the project root.  The new models will be applied to the database.  The SQL generated by the migrations (from the Django `./manage.py sqlmigrate` command) will also be shown in the console.
